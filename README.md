# 🏧 ATM Machine Simulator (Python)

This is a beginner-friendly ATM simulation project built with Python. It allows users to interact with a simple ATM system  performing basic banking operations like checking balance, withdrawing cash, depositing money, and exiting the system.

What This Project Does:

With this project, a user can:

- Check their account balance  
- Deposit money  
- Withdraw money  
- Decide whether to perform another transaction  
- Exit the program safely

Skills Practiced:

- Python `input()` for user interaction  
- `if-else` and `elif` for decision-making  
- `while` loop for transaction repetition  
- Variables and logic for updating balance  
- Using `time.sleep()` to simulate real-life processing delays

Sample Output

Welcome to ATM Machine

1. Check Balance


2. Withdraw Cash


3. Deposit Money


4. Exit

Sample Output:

Select an option: 1
Your current balance is: $500

Would you like another transaction? (yes/no): yes

Processing... Please take your cash

Would you like another transaction? (yes/no): no
Thank you for banking with us!

How to Run:

1. Install Python if not already installed  
2. Save the code into a file (e.g., `atm_simulator.py`)  
3. Open a terminal or IDE and run the file  
4. Follow the on-screen options

What's Next?

In future versions, I might add:
- A login system (with pin/password)
- Support for multiple users
- Account history and mini statements
- File saving with transactions
